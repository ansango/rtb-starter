# Test and Lint

You can run unit tests in **watch mode** or run all serial tests **in current process**:

```bash
yarn test:watch #watch mode
yarn test:ci #current process
```

You can also run [ESlint](https://eslint.org/), tests and coverage:

```bash
yarn test
```

Or run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/):

```bash
yarn lint
```

> Before you can commit to your repository ESlint and all tests will be run, if they fail [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) will not let you commit.
